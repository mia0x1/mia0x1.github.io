Hi, my name is Julian. I’m a tech enthusiast with a deep love for topics related to security, system administration, and IT in general. Oh, and I also have a strong passion for coffee!

### What You'll Find Here?

This blog reflects my interests and showcases some of the projects I’ve worked on along the way. Here’s what you can expect:

* Security: Write-ups of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, tinkering with security tools like honeypots, and discussions about vulnerabilities and security trends.
* System Administration and Self-Hosting: Tutorials on hosting containerized services with Docker and optimizing infrastructure.
* Privacy: Ways to protect your digital footprint and enhance online security.
* Scripting Projects: Scripts for practical use cases, like a TCP port scanner written in Bash.
* Personal Reflections: Thoughts on goal setting, productivity, and topics that inspire me.

Feel free to share your thoughts on what I’ve written or simply drop a comment to connect on [Mastodon](https://social.tchncs.de/@mialikescoffee)!

### Why mialikescoffee.com?

The name refers to the character **Mia Wallace** from the Tarantino movie Pulp Fiction from 1994.

I also enjoy drinking coffee (especially when writing articles and researching) and am interested in various ways of making it (currently my favorite is filter coffee from the Hario V60).
