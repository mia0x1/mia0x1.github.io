Hi. My name is Julian and this is my personal blog where I write about topics that I find exciting.

These include:

* IT security
* privacy
* CTFs (capture the flag)
* and other IT-related topics


### Why mialikescoffee.com ?

The name refers to the character **Mia Wallace** from the Tarantino movie Pulp Fiction from 1994.

I also enjoy drinking coffee (especially when writing articles and researching) and am interested in various ways of making it (currently my favorite is filter coffee from the Hario V60).
