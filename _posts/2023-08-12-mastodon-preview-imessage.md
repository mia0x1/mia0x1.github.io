title: Rich Preview von Mastodon Posts in iMessage

Since the release of iOS 16.4, iMessage has introduced the “Rich Preview” feature for content posted on Mastodon. Specifically, this means that iMessage retrieves details about a post, such as the text, the author’s account, and images, and displays them within the conversation.

Although this feature has been part of iOS and macOS for several months now, I still find it absolutely fascinating. Apple is helping to bring Mastodon out of its original niche and recognize the decentralized network as a fully-fledged social medium. I think Apple has done an excellent job here.

I hope this feature has a positive impact on how people use Mastodon and share content from the network with one another. Other messengers, like Signal, could take inspiration from this and offer similarly designed previews for Mastodon content. This would not only improve usability but also promote the visibility and acceptance of decentralized social platforms.
