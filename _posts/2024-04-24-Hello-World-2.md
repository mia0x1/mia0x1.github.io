title: Hello World 2.0 - A New Beginning?
---

Not really, just a small pivot in this blog.
From now on I will write my blog posts in English instead of German. Although I am not a native speaker, I hope this will simply make the blog more accessible to a wider audience on the internet.
And most of the tools and blogs I use are in English anyway.
From time to time, I will translate old posts.

So have fun reading, and see you soon :)
